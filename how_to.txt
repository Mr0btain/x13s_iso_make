Made it, hopefully, much more simple
    Added universal UUID - TBD
    updated kernel - 6.0.3
    changed to Ubuntu jammy
    added post install patch link to desktop
        run after install, ensure linux install directory is mounted
        to /target. varify after by checking efi partition for files
        bootaa64, grub.cfg and grubaa64. check grub.cfg and verify
        the UUIDs are correct. Very much in Beta so no promises haha.

What works:
    battery
    wifi
    touchscreen - included service to fix binding on startup
    USB works great
    Multitouch
    EFI boot manager - you can now use efibootmgr

Not working
    Sound - Kernel commits show its coming
    WWAN - Problem with ubuntu i think, working on it
    Bluetooth
    GPU - software rendering for now
    Camera - im sorry but i dont really care about the camera haha
    Graphical boot - right now its very much verbose - low on the list


UP NEXT:
    Improve after install patch
        Maybe use os-prober
        get .desktop shortcut to be trusted in installer
    Figure out WWAN issue
    Work on Sound
        Kernel work is being done, check steev's sc8280xp-next repo
    

good luck! =D
