You will have to replace the UUID part in the grub.cfg with that of the drive you have
your kernel on, while in live env it should be mounted to target. a fallback is auto included 
in the grub.cfg that is in case you install another kernel and things go wrong, it will fall 
back on the .old versions of vlinuz and initrd.img.
